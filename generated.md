This is an excellent and well-thought-out idea. You are proposing to evolve the Information Score from a global, static measure of uncertainty into a dynamic, context-aware metric that prioritizes which "unknowns" are more valuable to resolve.

Let's call your new metric the **Personalized Information Score (P-Score)**.

The core innovation is exactly as you described: instead of `cn` and `ce` being constant for the whole graph, they become functions `cn(i)` and `ce(j)` calculated for each specific unknown node `i` and unknown edge `j`.

### The Proposed P-Score Formula

The original I-Score formula is:
`I-Score = cn * Σ(pi * log(1/pi)) + ce * Σ(qi * log(1/qi))`

Your new **P-Score** formula would be:
`P-Score = Σ( cn(i) * pi * log(1/pi) ) + Σ( ce(j) * qj * log(1/qj) )`

Where:
*   The sum for nodes is over the set of unknown nodes `Sn`.
*   The sum for edges is over the set of unknown edges `Se`.
*   `cn(i)` is the calculated relevance score for a specific unknown node `i`.
*   `ce(j)` is the calculated relevance score for a specific unknown edge `j`.

### Calculating the Relevance Factors `cn(i)` and `ce(j)`

As you suggested, these factors are a weighted sum of several metrics. Let's define the metrics you proposed:

**1. Query Frequency (QF):**
*   **What it is:** The normalized frequency that a specific unknown node or edge appears in user search queries.
*   **Why it matters:** This is a direct measure of user interest and relevance. An uncertainty that users frequently ask about is more important to resolve.
*   **Calculation:** `QF(i) = (Queries involving item i) / (Total queries)`

**2. Timeliness (T):**
*   **What it is:** A measure of how recently the node or related entities were created or updated.
*   **Why it matters:** In many domains (news, social media, tech), newer information is more relevant.
*   **Calculation:** Can be calculated with a decay function, e.g., `T(i) = e^(-decay_rate * age_of_node)`.

**3. Class Instantiation Ratio (CIR) - for nodes:**
*   **What it is:** A measure of how well-populated the class of an unknown node is.
*   **Why it matters:** Resolving an uncertainty about a node belonging to a major class (e.g., a new `Person` or `Company`) is often more valuable than for a niche class.
*   **Calculation:** `CIR(i) = (Instances of node i's class) / (Total instances in KG)`

**4. Property Instantiation Ratio (PIR) - for edges:**
*   **What it is:** The global frequency of the property (predicate) used in an unknown edge.
*   **Why it matters:** Resolving an unknown edge with a fundamental property (e.g., `is-a`, `born-in`) adds more structural knowledge than resolving a rare, domain-specific property.
*   **Calculation:** `PIR(j) = (Count of property j) / (Total number of edges)`

### Putting It All Together: An Example

Let's imagine a knowledge graph about scientific research. We want to calculate the P-Score contribution for one specific unknown edge: **"(Paper_X, cites, ?)"**.

Assume the probability of this edge being unknown is `q = 0.5`.

**Step 1: Define Your Relevance Weights**
First, you decide what's most important for your application. Let's say user interest is paramount.
*   `w_QF = 0.5` (Query Frequency)
*   `w_PIR = 0.3` (Property Instantiation)
*   `w_T = 0.2` (Timeliness)

**Step 2: Calculate Metrics for the Edge**
For the edge `(Paper_X, cites, ?)`:
*   **Query Frequency:** Let's say `Paper_X` is a very popular paper, and many users search for what it cites. The normalized `QF` score is high, e.g., **0.9**.
*   **Property Instantiation:** The `cites` property is extremely common and structurally important in a research graph. The normalized `PIR` score is very high, e.g., **0.95**.
*   **Timeliness:** `Paper_X` was published last month, so it's very timely. The normalized `T` score is high, e.g., **0.8**.

**Step 3: Calculate the Personalized Importance Factor `ce(j)`**
`ce(j) = (w_QF * QF) + (w_PIR * PIR) + (w_T * T)`
`ce(j) = (0.5 * 0.9) + (0.3 * 0.95) + (0.2 * 0.8)`
`ce(j) = 0.45 + 0.285 + 0.16 = **0.895**`

**Step 4: Calculate the P-Score Contribution for this Edge**
`P-Score_contribution = ce(j) * q * log(1/q)`
`P-Score_contribution = 0.895 * 0.5 * log(1/0.5)`
`P-Score_contribution ≈ 0.895 * (0.347) ≈ **0.31**`

By calculating this for every unknown in the graph and summing the results, you get a total P-Score. This score now reflects not just the *amount* of uncertainty, but the **value** of that uncertainty according to your defined priorities. It can be used to guide data acquisition, suggesting that finding the citations for `Paper_X` is a high-priority task.
