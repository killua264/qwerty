Excellent. Providing these formal definitions gives us the specific, rigorous building blocks needed to construct the complete framework. We can now define every component with mathematical precision.

Let's integrate these formal definitions into the **Localized, Personalized Knowledge Management Framework**, clearly distinguishing between their application at the full KG level and the subgraph level.

### The Complete Framework: A Formal Definition

The framework's goal is to use a set of precise metrics to diagnose the health, relevance, and completeness of a Knowledge Graph, both globally and within specific topical subgraphs. This enables data-driven strategic decisions.

### Layer 1: The Core Metrics (Formally Defined)

Here is a breakdown of each metric, explaining its role at both the global and localized levels.

#### 1. Query Frequency (QF)

This metric measures user interest and active utilization.

*   **Global Level (QF):**
    *   **Formula:** `QF = TQ(I) / TQ(SC)`
    *   **Explanation:** As defined, this measures the popularity of an item `I` (a node or edge) relative to the total popularity of its parent class (`SC`). This is a sophisticated form of normalization, telling you how important an item is *within its own category* at a global scale. For example, it measures how often "Albert Einstein" is queried compared to all queries for the `Scientist` class.
*   **Localized Level (Subgraph Query Frequency - SQF):**
    *   **Formula Adaptation:** `SQF = TQ_subgraph(I) / TQ_subgraph(SC)`
    *   **Explanation:** The formula is adapted to the subgraph's context. `TQ_subgraph(I)` counts only the queries for item `I` that originate from users or applications interacting with that specific subgraph. `TQ_subgraph(SC)` counts the total queries for the super-class *within that same subgraph context*. This correctly identifies entities that are critically important to a niche topic, even if they aren't globally popular.

#### 2. Timeliness (T)

This metric evaluates the freshness of data.

*   **Global & Localized Levels:**
    *   **Formula:** `T(Ni) = exp(-λΔt)`
    *   **Explanation:** This formula is inherently node-specific, so it works identically at both levels. `T(Ni)` gives the timeliness score for a single node `Ni`. Its power in the localized framework comes from *aggregation*. We can calculate the **Average Subgraph Timeliness** by averaging `T(Ni)` for all nodes `Ni` within a subgraph. A high average timeliness signifies a "hot" or rapidly evolving topic.

#### 3. Class Instantiation Ratio (CIR)

This metric measures the prevalence of a given class.

*   **Global Level (CIR):**
    *   **Formula:** `CIR(Class C) = N(IC) / N(I)`
    *   **Explanation:** This measures the proportion of a class's instances relative to all instances in the entire KG. It tells you if a class like `Person` or `Organization` is a foundational concept for the whole KG.
*   **Localized Level (Subgraph Class Instantiation Ratio - SCIR):**
    *   **Formula Adaptation:** `SCIR(Class C) = N_subgraph(IC) / N_subgraph(I)`
    *   **Explanation:** We adapt the formula to measure the class's prevalence *within the subgraph*. `N_subgraph(IC)` is the number of instances of class C in the subgraph, and `N_subgraph(I)` is the total number of instances in the subgraph. This highlights classes that are foundational *to a specific topic*.

#### 4. Property Instantiation Ratio (PIR)

This metric measures how frequently a specific relationship (edge) is used.

*   **Global Level (PIR):**
    *   **Formula:** `PIR(Property P) = N(IP) / N(T)`
    *   **Explanation:** This measures the number of triples using a specific property `P` against the total number of triples in the entire KG. It identifies structurally important relationships like `rdf:type` or `foaf:knows` at a global level.
*   **Localized Level (Subgraph Property Instantiation Ratio - SPIR):**
    *   **Formula Adaptation:** `SPIR(Property P) = N_subgraph(IP) / N_subgraph(T)`
    *   **Explanation:** We measure the property's frequency *within the subgraph*. This identifies relationships that are critically important to a specific domain (e.g., the `cites` property in a "Scientific Publications" subgraph).

#### 5. Subgraph Instantiation Ratio (SIR)

This metric measures the average "completeness" of instances within a subgraph.

*   **This is inherently a Localized Level metric.**
    *   **Formula:** `SIR(Graph G) = (Σ [Number of classes instantiated in i-th instance / Total number of classes in subgraph]) / n`
    *   **Explanation:** As defined, this is a core diagnostic tool for subgraphs. It doesn't measure uncertainty, but rather **structural maturity**. A high SIR means the entities in the subgraph are well-described and mature. A low SIR means there are significant gaps in class-typing, indicating an incomplete or nascent domain.

### Layer 2: The Personalized P-Score (Formally Defined)

The P-Score uses the metrics above to calculate the **valuable uncertainty**.

*   **Global P-Score:**
    *   **Formula:** `P-Score = Σ( cn(i) * pi * log(1/pi) ) + Σ( ce(j) * qj * log(1/qj) )`
    *   **Relevance Factor Calculation (Example):**
        *   `cn(i) = w1*CIR(class of i) + w2*T(i) + w3*QF(i)`
        *   `ce(j) = w1*PIR(property of j) + w2*T(j) + w3*QF(j)`
        *   (Where `w` are the weights you assign to each factor based on your strategy).

*   **Localized P-Score (for a Subgraph G):**
    *   **Formula:** `P-Score(G) = Σ( cn_local(i) * pi * log(1/pi) ) + Σ( ce_local(j) * qj * log(1/qj) )`
    *   **Relevance Factor Calculation (Example):**
        *   `cn_local(i) = w1*SCIR(class of i) + w2*T(i) + w3*SQF(i)`
        *   `ce_local(j) = w1*SPIR(property of j) + w2*T(j) + w3*SQF(j)`
