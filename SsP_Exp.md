### **4. Utilization on a Large-Scale Knowledge Graph**

To demonstrate the practical utility and diagnostic power of our proposed framework, we simulate its application on a large-scale, hypothetical academic knowledge graph, the **Global Research Knowledge Graph (GRKG)**.

**4.1 Scenario: The Global Research Knowledge Graph (GRKG)**

The GRKG is modeled after real-world academic KGs like DBLP, Semantic Scholar, and Scopus.
*   **Scale:** Contains over 2 billion triples.
*   **Entities (Nodes):** `Paper`, `Author`, `Institution`, `Conference`, `FieldOfStudy`.
*   **Relationships (Edges):** `authoredBy`, `affiliatedWith`, `publishedIn`, `cites`.
*   **Goal:** The administrators of a university's research portal use the GRKG as their backend. Their objective is to efficiently allocate resources to improve the portal's data quality, ensuring that the information is accurate, relevant, and timely for their researchers.

The administrators decide to use the SS-PRISM framework to analyze three distinct `FieldOfStudy` subgraphs to inform their strategy:
*   **Subgraph A: "AI in Medicine"** - A rapidly evolving, high-impact interdisciplinary field.
*   **Subgraph B: "Classical Physics"** - A foundational, mature, and stable field.
*   **Subgraph C: "Cold Fusion Research (1980s)"** - A field that saw a brief surge of interest but is now largely dormant.

**4.2 Detailed Calculation Walkthrough: Subgraph A ("AI in Medicine")**

We will now perform a detailed, step-by-step calculation of the health profile for Subgraph A.

**Step 1: Identify an Unknown Entity and Calculate Its Importance (`c_e`)**

Within the "AI in Medicine" subgraph, the system identifies an **unknown `cites` relationship**. A new paper, *P_new* ("Deep Learning for Genomic Sequencing," published last month), might cite a foundational paper, *P_found* ("Statistical Models in Genetics," published 5 years ago). The system flags this potential link as an unknown edge `e_j` with an uncertainty probability `q_j = 0.5`. We must calculate its edge importance factor, `c_e`.

*   **A) Calculate Timeliness (T):**
    The edge's timeliness is based on the newest node, *P_new*. Let `t_c` be now and `t_d` be 1 month ago. With a decay rate `Î» = 0.1`, timeliness is high:
    `T = exp(-0.1 * 1) = 0.905`

*   **B) Calculate Property Instantiation Ratio (PIR):**
    The `cites` property is fundamental to the entire GRKG.
    `Total Triples in GRKG: 2,000,000,000`
    `Triples with 'cites' property: 250,000,000`
    `PIR('cites') = 250M / 2B = 0.125`. After normalization across all properties, this high value corresponds to a normalized score of `Norm(PIR) = 0.92`.

*   **C) Calculate Subgraph Importance (SI):**
    This metric reflects user engagement with the connected nodes.
    `TQ(P_new)`: 1,500 queries this month (very popular).
    `TQ(Class: Paper)`: 10,000,000 queries this month.
    `SI(P_new) = 1500 / 10M = 0.00015`.
    `SI(P_found)`: Consistently queried, `SI = 0.00008`.
    The combined SI for the edge is the average, and after normalization across the graph, this high engagement gives `Norm(SI) = 0.88`.

*   **D) Calculate the Edge Importance Factor (`c_e`):**
    Assuming equal weights (`w = 1/3`) for simplicity:
    `c_e(e_j) = (1/3 * 0.905) + (1/3 * 0.92) + (1/3 * 0.88) = 0.902`
    This is a very high importance factor, indicating this unknown edge is highly relevant.

*   **E) Calculate the PRISM Contribution of this Edge:**
    `Contribution = c_e * q_j * log(1/q_j) = 0.902 * 0.5 * log(1/0.5) = 0.313`

**Step 2: Aggregate to Compute Subgraph Health Metrics**

This process is repeated for all unknown nodes and edges within the "AI in Medicine" subgraph.

*   **A) Subgraph-Scoped PRISM Score (SS-PRISM):**
    The sum of all individual contributions (like the one calculated above) results in a high score, indicating many valuable unknowns.
    `SS-PRISM (AI in Medicine) = 1,245,000`

*   **B) Subgraph Instantiation Ratio (SIR):**
    The "AI in Medicine" domain schema defines 5 required classes: `Paper`, `Gene`, `Protein`, `ClinicalTrial`, `Drug`. The current subgraph has many instances of `Paper` and `Gene`, and some `Protein`, but no instances of `ClinicalTrial` or `Drug` yet.
    `SIR = (Number of classes instantiated) / (Total defined classes) = 3 / 5 = 0.60`

*   **C) Subgraph Timeliness (T_sub):**
    Most entities in this field are recent. The average of all Timeliness (T) scores is high.
    `T_sub (AI in Medicine) = 0.82`

*   **D) Subgraph Importance (SI_sub):**
    This field is a hot topic, receiving a disproportionately high number of queries relative to its size.
    `SI_sub (AI in Medicine) = 0.91` (normalized)

**4.3 Diagnostic Dashboard and Actionable Insights**

After performing the same calculations for the other two subgraphs, the university administrators are presented with the following diagnostic dashboard (Table 2).

**Table 2: SS-PRISM Diagnostic Dashboard for the GRKG**
| Subgraph | SS-PRISM Score | SIR | T_sub | SI_sub | Inferred Profile |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **A: AI in Medicine** | **1,245,000** | **0.60** | **0.82** | **0.91** | **Active Research Front / Incomplete Foundation** |
| **B: Classical Physics** | 110,000 | 0.98 | 0.15 | 0.85 | **Mature & Stable Core** |
| **C: Cold Fusion (1980s)** | 5,200 | 0.85 | 0.02 | 0.01 | **Stale Archive** |

**Interpretation and Strategic Actions:**

1.  **Subgraph A (AI in Medicine):** The extremely high **SS-PRISM** score confirms this is where the most valuable uncertainty lies. The low **SIR** (0.60) is a critical diagnostic finding, revealing that the subgraph is structurally incomplete. The high **Timeliness** and **Importance** confirm its relevance.
    *   **Action:** **PRIORITIZE & INGEST.** Allocate significant human and computational resources here. Launch targeted crawlers to ingest data for the missing `ClinicalTrial` and `Drug` classes. Use the high PRISM score to prioritize which specific citation links and author affiliations need verification first.

2.  **Subgraph B (Classical Physics):** The low **SS-PRISM** score indicates few important knowledge gaps. The high **SIR** (0.98) shows it is structurally complete. Its low **Timeliness** is expected, but its high **Importance** (0.85) proves it is a critical, foundational part of the KG.
    *   **Action:** **MONITOR.** This subgraph is a stable asset. No active investment is needed. Resources should be allocated only for routine maintenance and servicing user queries.

3.  **Subgraph C (Cold Fusion Research - 1980s):** All metrics are extremely low. The PRISM score is negligible, and both **Timeliness** and user **Importance** are near zero. It contains few valuable unknowns and is irrelevant to the current user base.
    *   **Action:** **PRUNE.** This subgraph is a clear candidate for being moved to an offline archive. Pruning it from the active KG will reduce index size, improve query performance across the graph, and decrease maintenance overhead.

This utilization case demonstrates how the SS-PRISM framework provides a nuanced, data-driven methodology for managing KG resources effectively, moving beyond a single quality score to a rich, actionable diagnostic summary.
