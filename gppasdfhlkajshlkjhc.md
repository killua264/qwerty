# **1. Introduction**

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become foundational infrastructures in modern AI systems, underpinning applications such as semantic search, personalized recommendation, and complex question answering. The utility of a KG depends critically on the **completeness, accuracy, and timeliness** of its encoded knowledge. However, as these graphs scale to billions of nodes and edges, manual curation becomes infeasible, necessitating **automated methods** for continuous quality assessment and maintenance.

Despite progress in KG evaluation, existing approaches remain inadequate for guiding practical curation decisions. Traditional metrics—such as node count, edge density, or even global entropy-based scores—tend to be **static and coarse-grained**, offering little insight into the dynamic and heterogeneous value of different knowledge segments. More problematically, these metrics typically assume **uniform importance across all unknowns**, neglecting the reality that some information gaps are far more consequential than others. For instance, missing facts about trending topics or frequently queried entities may critically impair downstream applications, whereas obscure or rarely accessed content contributes marginally to performance.

This paper addresses a central, underexplored challenge in KG management: **the need for a relevance-aware, diagnostic framework that localizes and prioritizes knowledge gaps based on contextual value**. We argue that effective KG evaluation must go beyond quantifying uncertainty; it must identify **what is most valuable to discover**.

To this end, we introduce a novel two-stage framework:

* First, we propose the **Personalized Relevance-weighted Information Score (PRISM)**, which extends information-theoretic uncertainty measures by integrating **timeliness, structural significance, and user engagement** into a single, relevance-aware metric.
* Second, we present the **Subgraph-Scoped PRISM (SS-PRISM)** framework, which applies PRISM at a localized subgraph level, enabling fine-grained diagnostics of KG "health" and facilitating **targeted maintenance strategies**.

### Contributions

This work makes the following contributions:

1. We introduce **PRISM**, a novel metric for prioritizing unknown information in KGs by incorporating contextual relevance signals derived from structure, usage, and recency.
2. We develop **SS-PRISM**, a framework for generating **localized health profiles** of subgraphs within a KG, supporting diagnostic and decision-making tasks.
3. We demonstrate that our framework enables actionable insights for KG lifecycle management, including **readiness evaluation**, **staleness detection**, and **strategic pruning**.

The remainder of this paper formalizes our methodology, validates it empirically on real-world datasets, and discusses implications for scalable and intelligent KG maintenance.

# **3. Methodology**

We present a two-stage methodology to move from static, global metrics toward **context-sensitive, diagnostic assessments** of knowledge graphs. The first stage formulates the **PRISM** score, integrating multiple relevance signals to quantify **prioritized uncertainty**. The second stage applies PRISM within the **SS-PRISM** framework to diagnose the internal state of a KG at subgraph granularity.

## **3.1 Foundational Relevance Metrics**

To compute relevance-weighted uncertainty, we define a set of foundational signals that capture **temporal relevance, structural centrality**, and **user interaction**. These signals are computed at the node, class, and property levels.

### **3.1.1 Timeliness (T)**

Measures how recently a node or edge was updated or added, using an exponential decay function:

$$
T(N_i) = \exp(-\lambda(t_c - t_d(N_i)))
$$

where $t_c$ is the current timestamp, $t_d(N_i)$ is the last modification time of node $N_i$, and $\lambda$ is a decay-rate parameter.

### **3.1.2 Class Instantiation Ratio (CIR)**

Represents the structural prominence of a class within the KG:

$$
\text{CIR}(C) = \frac{N(IC)}{N(I)}
$$

where $N(IC)$ is the number of instances of class $C$, and $N(I)$ is the total number of instances in the KG.

### **3.1.3 Property Instantiation Ratio (PIR)**

Quantifies the prevalence of a property across the KG:

$$
\text{PIR}(P) = \frac{N(IP)}{N(T)}
$$

where $N(IP)$ is the number of triples using property $P$, and $N(T)$ is the total number of triples.

### **3.1.4 Subgraph Importance (SI)**

Estimates the **user-centric importance** of a node based on query access:

$$
\text{SI}(I) = \frac{TQ(I)}{TQ(SC)}
$$

where $TQ(I)$ is the total number of queries accessing instance $I$, and $TQ(SC)$ is the total queries for its superclass $SC$.

## **3.2 PRISM: Relevance-weighted Information Score**

PRISM extends traditional entropy-based uncertainty quantification by applying **personalized relevance weights** to each unknown node and edge. Formally, the PRISM score is defined as:

$$
\text{PRISM} = \sum_{i \in S_n} c_n(i) \cdot p_i \log \frac{1}{p_i} + \sum_{j \in S_e} c_e(j) \cdot q_j \log \frac{1}{q_j}
$$

Where:

* $S_n$, $S_e$: sets of unknown nodes and edges, respectively.
* $p_i$, $q_j$: probabilities of being unknown (can be estimated via KG completion models).
* $c_n(i)$, $c_e(j)$: relevance weights derived from foundational metrics.

### **3.2.1 Node Importance Weight $c_n$**

$$
c_n(i) = w_{CIR} \cdot \text{Norm}(CIR_i) + w_{SI} \cdot \text{Norm}(SI_i) + w_T \cdot \text{Norm}(T_i)
$$

### **3.2.2 Edge Importance Weight $c_e$**

$$
c_e(j) = w_{PIR} \cdot \text{Norm}(PIR_j) + w_{SI} \cdot \text{Norm}(SI_j) + w_T \cdot \text{Norm}(T_j)
$$

Weights $w_{CIR}, w_{SI}, w_T, w_{PIR}$ can be tuned per application. All metrics are normalized to \[0,1].

## **3.3 SS-PRISM: Subgraph-Scoped Framework**

To localize diagnostics, we partition the KG into **meaningful subgraphs** $G_s$—defined by class hierarchy, topical domain, or user segment—and compute PRISM-based diagnostics at this level.

### **3.3.1 Subgraph PRISM**

$$
\text{SS-PRISM}(G_s) = \text{PRISM applied only to } G_s
$$

This score highlights the **volume of prioritized uncertainty** localized in a subgraph.

### **3.3.2 Subgraph Completeness: SIR**

$$
\text{SIR}(G_s) = \frac{|\{C \in G_s: N(IC) > 0\}|}{|\{C \in G_s\}|}
$$

Measures class coverage within the subgraph.

### **3.3.3 Subgraph Timeliness: $T_{\text{sub}}$**

$$
T_{\text{sub}} = \frac{1}{|G_s|} \sum_{i \in G_s} T(i)
$$

### **3.3.4 Subgraph Importance: $SI_{\text{sub}}$**

$$
SI_{\text{sub}} = \frac{\sum_{i \in G_s} TQ(i)}{\sum_{i \in \text{domain}(G_s)} TQ(i)}
$$

## **3.4 Diagnosing Subgraph Health**

We synthesize the above scores into a **diagnostic dashboard** to guide maintenance decisions. Table 1 summarizes how different metric combinations imply actionable subgraph states.

### **Table 1: Subgraph Health Profiles**

| Profile                   | SS-PRISM |   SIR   | Timeliness | SI\_sub | Suggested Action                   |
| :------------------------ | :------: | :-----: | :--------: | :-----: | :--------------------------------- |
| **Active Research Front** |   High   | Low/Med |    High    |   High  | Prioritize curation and enrichment |
| **Incomplete Foundation** |   High   |   Low   |   Low/Med  |   High  | Fill missing structure and schema  |
| **Mature Core**           |    Low   |   High  |     Low    |   High  | Monitor, low maintenance           |
| **Stale Archive**         |    Low   |   High  |     Low    |   Low   | Prune or archive                   |
| **Emerging Opportunity**  |   High   | Low/Med |    High    |   Low   | Monitor for growth potential       |

This framework provides **interpretable, quantitative signals** for dynamically managing large-scale KGs and aligns resource allocation with knowledge utility.
