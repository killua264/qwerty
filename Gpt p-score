3. Methods

3.1 Overview

This study evaluates the structural health, relevance, and completeness of a Knowledge Graph (KG) using a formally defined, layered metric system. We adopt a Localized, Personalized Knowledge Management Framework that integrates both global and subgraph-level analyses. The framework quantifies various facets of the KG’s condition using a set of core metrics, culminating in a composite P-Score that captures the uncertainty and strategic value of missing information.

3.2 Core Metric Definitions

We define five base metrics that serve as the foundation of our framework. Each metric is computed both at the global level (entire KG) and the localized level (topical subgraphs), unless otherwise noted.

3.2.1 Query Frequency (QF, SQF)

Purpose: Measures user interest and utilization intensity.

Global Query Frequency (QF):

where  is the total queries for item , and  is the total queries for the item's parent class.

Localized Query Frequency (SQF):

This reflects item interest within a particular topical subgraph.


3.2.2 Timeliness (T)

Purpose: Assesses the temporal freshness of each node.

Formula:

where  is the time since last update of node .
This is used both globally and locally, and can be averaged across subgraphs for macro-level analysis.


3.2.3 Class Instantiation Ratio (CIR, SCIR)

Purpose: Indicates class coverage and completeness.

Global CIR:

where  is the number of instances of class , and  is the total number of instances.

Localized SCIR:



3.2.4 Property Instantiation Ratio (PIR, SPIR)

Purpose: Measures relationship usage frequency.

Global PIR:

where  is the number of triples involving property , and  is the total number of triples in the KG.

Localized SPIR:



3.2.5 Subgraph Instantiation Ratio (SIR)

Purpose: Evaluates structural completeness within a subgraph.

Formula (Localized Only):



A high SIR suggests that entities within the subgraph are well-typed and structurally mature.

3.3 Composite Metric: The P-Score

To integrate uncertainty and strategic value into a single diagnostic value, we introduce the P-Score, a personalized metric calculated using the entropy of unknown or missing entities, weighted by their structural and user relevance.

3.3.1 Global P-Score

Formula:


P\text{-Score} = \sum_i \left[ c_n(i) \cdot p_i \cdot \log\left(\frac{1}{p_i}\right) \right] + \sum_j \left[ c_e(j) \cdot q_j \cdot \log\left(\frac{1}{q_j}\right) \right]

Relevance Factors:


c_n(i) = w_1 \cdot CIR(class(i)) + w_2 \cdot T(i) + w_3 \cdot QF(i)

c_e(j) = w_1 \cdot PIR(property(j)) + w_2 \cdot T(j) + w_3 \cdot QF(j) ]

3.3.2 Localized P-Score

Formula:


P\text{-Score}(G) = \sum_i \left[ c_{n\_local}(i) \cdot p_i \cdot \log\left(\frac{1}{p_i}\right) \right] + \sum_j \left[ c_{e\_local}(j) \cdot q_j \cdot \log\left(\frac{1}{q_j}\right) \right]

Localized Relevance Factors:


c_{n\_local}(i) = w_1 \cdot SCIR(class(i)) + w_2 \cdot T(i) + w_3 \cdot SQF(i)

c_{e_local}(j) = w_1 \cdot SPIR(property(j)) + w_2 \cdot T(j) + w_3 \cdot SQF(j) ]

The weighting coefficients  are set based on analytical goals (e.g., prioritizing freshness vs. class coverage).

3.4 Evaluation and Interpretation

We apply these metrics to evaluate both the full KG and domain-specific subgraphs. The global metrics serve to identify high-level structural or usage patterns. In contrast, the localized metrics (e.g., SQF, SCIR, SPIR, SIR) support diagnostics of subgraph maturity and targeted maintenance.

By comparing subgraph P-Scores with associated SPIR, SQF, and SIR values, we can classify subgraphs into categories such as:

High Relevance, Low Completeness: Frequently queried but structurally sparse.

Low Relevance, High Completeness: Stable and mature, but low user interest.

Low Timeliness: Stale data nodes/edges indicating potential obsolescence.


This enables precise and informed intervention strategies, including targeted enrichment, pruning, or re-prioritization of KG subdomains.

=================================

Certainly. Below is a more detailed comparative analysis of the P-Score, Subgraph Instantiation Ratio (SIR), Subgraph Timeliness (ST), and Subgraph Query Frequency (SQF), showing how they interrelate, complement, and differ in practical use within Knowledge Graph (KG) evaluation.

3.5 Comparative Analysis of Subgraph-Level Metrics

To enable nuanced diagnosis and prioritization of KG subgraphs, we compare and contrast the behaviors, sensitivities, and implications of the four key localized metrics: P-Score, Subgraph Instantiation Ratio (SIR), Subgraph Timeliness (ST), and Subgraph Query Frequency (SQF).

Metric	What it Measures	Strengths	Limitations	Ideal Use Cases

P-Score	Composite metric quantifying uncertainty & importance of missing data	Holistic and weighted; integrates structure, usage, and recency	Requires careful tuning of weights; more computationally intensive	Strategic prioritization; global/local completeness scoring
SIR (Subgraph Instantiation Ratio)	Structural completeness of entity typing in a subgraph	Simple, interpretable; highlights immature or incomplete domains	Ignores relevance or user demand; blind to freshness	Detecting structurally sparse or underdeveloped subgraphs
ST (Subgraph Timeliness)	Average data freshness across subgraph entities	Highlights staleness; useful for time-sensitive domains	Doesn't distinguish between critical and irrelevant nodes	Monitoring real-time domains (e.g., news, finance)
SQF (Subgraph Query Frequency)	User engagement with subgraph entities	Strong proxy for user interest and perceived value	May be skewed by frontend bias or system access	Identifying subgraphs deserving more attention/resources

3.5.1 Joint Interpretation Scenarios

To illustrate how these metrics interact, we present common combinations and what they reveal:


---

Scenario A: High SQF, Low SIR, High P-Score

Interpretation: The subgraph is frequently queried, but structurally incomplete and uncertain.

Action: Prioritize this subgraph for enrichment. The high P-Score confirms that what’s missing is relevant.

Use Case: A scientific research domain where many papers are cited but not fully typed or linked.



---

Scenario B: Low SQF, High SIR, Low P-Score

Interpretation: Subgraph is structurally mature and complete, but users are not engaging with it.

Action: Consider archiving, reducing storage/maintenance cost, or promoting its visibility.

Use Case: An outdated taxonomy with excellent modeling but little real-world interaction.



---

Scenario C: High ST, Low SQF, High SIR, Low P-Score

Interpretation: Recently updated, well-modeled, but not yet attracting usage.

Action: May need better integration into applications or user-facing features.

Use Case: A new subgraph added for a niche market, technically sound but not yet adopted.



---

Scenario D: Low ST, High SQF, High P-Score

Interpretation: Heavily used subgraph that is stale and contains valuable missing data.

Action: Schedule immediate refresh and data crawling for this domain.

Use Case: A popular geopolitical subgraph with outdated country leadership information.



---

Scenario E: High SQF, High ST, High SIR, Low P-Score

Interpretation: Healthy subgraph—well-modeled, fresh, and popular—with few significant gaps.

Action: Minimal immediate intervention needed; serve as a reference model for other subgraphs.

Composite nature	✅ Combines multiple signals	❌	❌	❌
Sensitivity to relevance	✅ (via QF/SQF weights)	❌	❌	✅
Sensitivity to data freshness	✅ (via T weights)	❌	✅	❌
Sensitivity to modeling maturity	✅ (via CIR/SCIR, PIR/SPIR)	✅	❌	❌
Risk of overestimation	Moderate (depends on weights)	Low	Low	High (click or surface bias)

3.5.3 Complementarity Summary

Each of the metrics serves a distinct role:

P-Score gives a strategic view—"How valuable and uncertain is what we’re missing?"

SIR gives a structural view—"Is this subgraph complete from a schema perspective?"

ST gives a temporal view—"Is this subgraph up to date?"

SQF gives a demand view—"Do people or applications care about this subgraph?"


Together, they enable precise, multi-faceted KG maintenance decisions.
